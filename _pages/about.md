I am a PhD Researcher in [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://utsausl.wixsite.com/utsausl) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. My research interests include reinforcement learning, multi-objective reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and autonomous systems. Specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning that can learn to collaborate and solve complex tasks. I am also interested in developing algorithms for multi-objective reinforcement learning that can learn to balance multiple objectives in a single environment. Moreover, I am also interested in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn to control autonomous systems, such as drones and autonomous vehicles. I am also interested in applying these algorithms to real-world problems, such as traffic management, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
