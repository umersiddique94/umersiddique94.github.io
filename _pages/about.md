As a PhD Researcher in the [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://utsausl.wixsite.com/utsausl) at the University of Texas at San Antonio, I am passionate about advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on reinforcement learning and autonomous systems. My research interests span multi-agent and multi-objective reinforcement learning, as well as the application of these techniques to control autonomous systems like drones and vehicles. I am dedicated to developing innovative algorithms that enable effective collaboration among multiple agents, balance complex objectives, and solve real-world challenges in areas such as traffic management, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. By bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, I aim to contribute meaningful solutions that can positively impact society and further the mission of the USL in advancing unmanned systems technology.
