I am excited to announce that I have joined the [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://utsausl.wixsite.com/utsausl) at the University of Texas at San Antonio as a PhD Researcher. I am looking forward to working with Dr. Yongcan Cao and the rest of the team on exciting research projects in the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on reinforcement learning and autonomous systems. Stay tuned for updates on my research and publications!
