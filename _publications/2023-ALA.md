Learning fair policies in reinforcement learning (RL) is important when the RL agent’s actions may impact many users. In this paper, we investigate a generalization of this problem where equity is still desired, but some users may be entitled to preferential treatment. We formalize this more sophisticated fair optimization problem in deep RL, provide some theoretical discussion of its difficulties, and explain how existing deep RL algorithms can be adapted to tackle it. Our algorithmic innovations notably include a state-augmented DQN-based method for learning stochastic policies, which also applies to the usual fair optimization setting without any preferential treatment. We empirically validate our propositions and analyze the experimental results on several application domains. This paper was selected as the best paper at the Adaptive Learning Agents Workshop @ AAMAS 2023. [Download paper here](https://alaworkshop2023.github.io/papers/ALA2023_paper_34.pdf)
